## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## Live Deployment
This site was built using Github Pages => [QR code component](https://jankee92pl.github.io/QR-Code-Component-Hub/)




## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

The designs are in JPG static format. Using JPGs will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and fonts.
